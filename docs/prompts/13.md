	1.	Global import sweep
After deleting /reactShell/src/utils/units.ts, update any lingering imports repo-wide to the correct game/utils/units relative path. Include Asteroid.ts, any systems, and helpers not listed.
	2.	Starfield draw order
After creating the THREE.Points, set points.renderOrder = -1 to guarantee it stays behind sprites even if materials change later. Keep z = -10, depthTest = false, depthWrite = false, transparent = true, sizeAttenuation = true.
	3.	Unused imports
Remove pxToWorld imports anywhere it isnâ€™t referenced to avoid TS warnings, including Ship.ts and Bullet.ts if applicable.

Everything else is approved. Commit and push in one unified diff under /diffs/ with message:
fix(world): unify units module, restore starfield, normalize scale, ensure wave-1 asteroids.
