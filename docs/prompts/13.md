EXECUTION MODE — stability pass for GameCanvas. Output one unified diff under `/diffs/` only. Then commit and push.

Scope
- `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/GameCanvas.tsx`

Required Changes

1) Resize listener cleanup
- If the effect installs `window.addEventListener('resize', onResize)`, make sure the cleanup function also calls:
  ```ts
  window.removeEventListener('resize', onResize);

	•	Place this right next to cancelAnimationFrame(raf).

	2.	DevicePixelRatio on mount

	•	Before the very first renderer.setSize(width, height) during initialization, add:

renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio);


	•	This ensures the initial frame is rendered at the correct scale on high-DPI displays.

Constraints
	•	Do not change any other logic or files.
	•	Keep all existing imports and function signatures.
	•	Do not alter RAF delta handling — only add the cleanup and DPR call.

Deliverable
	•	Print ONE timestamped unified diff under /diffs/ with exactly these edits.
	•	Print the full patch inside a ```diff fenced block, no truncation, no summaries.
