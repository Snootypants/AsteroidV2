EXECUTION MODE — Create missing units module to fix imports. Output ONE unified diff under `/diffs/` only. Then commit and push.

Scope
- NEW: /AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/utils/units.ts

Exact file contents
```ts
// reactShell/src/game/utils/units.ts
// World units and bounds used by entities. Values match current wrap behavior.
export const WORLD_BOUNDS = {
  minX: -375,
  maxX: 375,
  minY: -249,
  maxY: 249,
} as const;

export type WorldBounds = typeof WORLD_BOUNDS;

/** Convert screen pixels to world units. Identity for now; adjust if a scale is introduced. */
export function pxToWorld(px: number): number {
  return px;
}

Constraints
	•	Do not modify any existing entity imports (../utils/units). They will resolve once this file exists.

Deliverable
	•	Print ONE timestamped unified diff under /diffs/ with the new file. No truncation.
	•	Then commit and push with message:
feat(units): add utils/units.ts exporting WORLD_BOUNDS and pxToWorld to resolve entity imports
