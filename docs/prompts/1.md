Strict scope correction and cleanup pass for last commit.

You are in planning mode. Read the repo state at `https://github.com/Snootypants/AsteroidV2.git` (last commit) and prepare the exact technical plan + diffs for the following corrections:

1. **Asset paths and casing**
   - All vanilla assets (`start_screen.png`, `gameEnd.png`, `hanger.png`, `ship.png`) must live directly under `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/public/` at the root if that is where vanilla references them. Do not bury them under `/public/assets/` unless vanilla used that path.
   - Fix casing: `Hanger.png` → `hanger.png`.
   - Mirror any subfolders that exist in `/vanillaHTML/` exactly, with identical casing and paths.

2. **Remove non-vanilla assets**
   - Delete `public/assets/boss/boss1.png … boss10.png` and any other extras not in `/vanillaHTML/`.
   - PRD requires strict parity only. No bosses, drones, ricochet, or epic upgrades.

3. **Three.js examples**
   - Detect the Three.js version used in `/vanillaHTML/index.html`. Confirm it (should be 0.158.0).
   - In `reactShell/package.json`, pin `three` to that version.
   - Install `three/examples` modules (`EffectComposer`, `RenderPass`, `UnrealBloomPass`, `OutlinePass`) and import them in a new stub `src/game/render/PostFX.ts`.
   - Build a placeholder composer chain (no real systems yet), just so version drift doesn’t bite later.

4. **Dependencies**
   - Move `@types/three` to `devDependencies`.

5. **Vite config**
   - Decide: keep or remove the forced `server.port = 3000`. If you keep it, add a note in `reactShell/README.md` so devs aren’t confused.

6. **Licensing**
   - You edited `vanillaHTML/LICENSE`. Add a copy (or symlink) at repo root so the license applies to `reactShell` too.

7. **Diff hygiene**
   - Continue to output every change as full unified diffs under `/diffs/` with timestamped filenames.

### Tasks for this pass
- Rename/move assets as above.
- Remove boss images and other non-vanilla assets.
- Adjust `package.json` (pin three, move @types/three).
- Create or update `src/game/render/PostFX.ts` with stub imports and composer pipeline.
- Add `reactShell/README.md` documenting:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`
  - Asset path expectations
  - Parity requirement
  - Note about port 3000 if kept
- Add LICENSE file at repo root.

### Deliverables
- Technical plan describing exactly what edits are required in each file.
- Then full unified diffs under `/diffs/` for all changes.
