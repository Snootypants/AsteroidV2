	1.	Ship.ts
Do not use userData.radius. Use the class field.
Set: sprite.scale.set(2 * this.radius, 2 * this.radius, 1);
	2.	GameCanvas.tsx
Ensure the starfield instance is stored and updated every frame.
Create before other entities. Call starfield.update(dt) each tick after camera updates.
	3.	Starfield.ts
Place stars at z = -10. Keep depthTest = false, depthWrite = false, transparent = true. Return an object with update(dt).
