Approved with edits. Apply these corrections to the plan before execution.
	1.	Ship.ts
Change the scale to derive from the actual radius, not a fixed 3.
Use the instance radius field. Example: sprite.scale.set(2 * this.radius, 2 * this.radius, 1);
	2.	Import sweep
After deleting /reactShell/src/utils/units.ts, update any file still importing from ../../utils/units or similar to point at the game/utils/units path relative to the file. Donâ€™t leave stale imports outside the files already listed.
	3.	Starfield z-order
Keep depthTest=false, depthWrite=false, and place at a negative z (for example -10) to guarantee it stays behind. Instantiate before other entities as you planned.

Everything else is good. Commit and push after generating one unified diff under /diffs/.
