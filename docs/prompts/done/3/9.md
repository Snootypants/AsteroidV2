Approved with edits.
	1.	Ship.ts
Remove “private radius = 1.5”. Use the existing class field. Set sprite.scale.set(2 * this.radius, 2 * this.radius, 1);
	2.	Spawning.ts
Explicitly confirm wave-1 spawns. If any guard uses wave > 1, change to wave >= 1. Keep counts and speeds unchanged.
	3.	Import sweep
After deleting /reactShell/src/utils/units.ts, update any remaining imports that still point at ../../utils/units (or similar) to the correct game/utils/units path relative to each file. Do not leave stale paths outside the listed files.
	4.	Starfield.ts
Keep stars at z = -10 and set depthTest = false, depthWrite = false, transparent = true. Return { update(dt) }.
	5.	GameCanvas.tsx
Instantiate starfield before other entities and call starfield.update(dt) every frame after camera updates.
