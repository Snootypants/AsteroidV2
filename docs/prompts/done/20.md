EXECUTION MODE — adjust ship visual size to 65px height. Output ONE unified diff under `/diffs/` only. Then commit and push.

Scope
- `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/entities/Ship.ts`

Changes
- Find the constant:
  ```ts
  const SHIP_DESIRED_PX = 85;

	•	Change it to:

const SHIP_DESIRED_PX = 65;


	•	This sets the ship’s rendered height to ~65 pixels on screen, preserving aspect ratio.

Constraints
	•	Do not modify any other logic or files.
	•	Ensure scaling still happens automatically when the texture loads.

Deliverable
	•	Print ONE timestamped unified diff under /diffs/ with this single-line change. No truncation, no summaries.
	•	After diff, commit and push.
