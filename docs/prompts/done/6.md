All right, time to move out of planning and into execution.

You now have the verified scope, assets, dependencies, and corrections locked. Do not add or remove features beyond what’s in `/AsteroidsV2/PRD.md`.

Execute the following immediately:

1. Remove `@types/three` from `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/package.json`. Three 0.158.0 ships with its own types.
2. Update `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/vite.config.ts`:
   - Add `base: './'`
   - Keep `server: { port: 3000 }`
3. Update `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/main.tsx`:
   - Remove the `React.StrictMode` wrapper so the Three renderer is not double-mounted in dev.
4. Create `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/render/PostFX.ts`:
   - Import `EffectComposer`, `RenderPass`, `UnrealBloomPass`, `OutlinePass` from `three/examples/jsm/postprocessing/…`
   - Use vanilla bloom parameters `(size, 0.9, 0.8, 0.85)` with threshold `0.2`, strength `1.25`, radius `0.6`
   - Call `renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio)` and `composer.setSize(width, height)`
   - Export `{ composer, resize, render }` where `render` calls `composer.render(delta)`
   - Ensure `renderer.outputColorSpace` matches vanilla
5. Copy `/AsteroidsV2/vanillaHTML/LICENSE` to `/AsteroidsV2/LICENSE` at repo root.
6. Create `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/README.md` with:
   - Commands: `npm install`, `npm run dev` (port 3000), `npm run build`, `npm run preview`
   - Asset rule: reference assets as `assets/...` (no leading slash), mirror vanilla exactly
   - Case sensitivity note: `git config core.ignorecase false` recommended
   - Strict parity requirement with vanilla build
   - Diff policy: all future changes must be committed as full unified diffs under `/diffs/`

Output a single timestamped unified diff under `/diffs/`, ready for `git apply`, that contains all of the above changes. Do not print explanations, only the diff file.
