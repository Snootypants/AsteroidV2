Scope lock and evidence-based corrections for the last commit.

You are in planning mode. Read the repo at `AsteroidV2` and verify claims against source files, not assumptions.

1) Validate vanilla asset usage and paths
- Open `/AsteroidsV2/vanillaHTML/index.html` and `/AsteroidsV2/vanillaHTML/src/main.js`.
- Confirm whether assets are referenced at root or under `assets/`. Record exact relative paths and casing for:
  - start_screen.png
  - gameEnd.png
  - hanger.png or Hanger.png (confirm exact filename)
  - ship.png
  - any boss images actually referenced
- If bosses are used, list the exact filenames and the lines where they are imported/loaded. If not used, mark them for removal.

2) Correct the React shell to mirror vanilla paths verbatim
- Ensure `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/public/` contains a byte-for-byte copy of the vanilla assets at identical relative paths and casing.
- If casing differs in the current commit (e.g., `Hanger.png` vs `hanger.png`), fix the filename or update code to match the real reference. Do not “standardize”; match vanilla.

3) Dependencies and examples
- From `vanillaHTML/index.html`, extract the Three.js version and any examples tag. Pin `three` in `reactShell/package.json` to that exact version.
- Move `@types/three` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`.
- Create `src/game/render/PostFX.ts` that imports `EffectComposer`, `RenderPass`, `UnrealBloomPass`, `OutlinePass`, and `ShaderPass` from the matching `three/examples/jsm` version. Build a stub composer pipeline that renders a scene without gameplay, just to lock versions.

4) Repo-level license
- Copy `vanillaHTML/LICENSE` to repo root as `/LICENSE` so it applies to `reactShell` too.

5) Developer README
- Add `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/README.md` documenting:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev` (note the port if forced to 3000)
  - `npm run build` and `npm run preview`
  - Asset path mirroring rules and strict parity requirement
  - Note that every change must be committed as a full unified diff under `/diffs/`

6) Deliverables and format
- First print a short verification report with file paths, exact filenames, and the line numbers in `main.js` that show asset references and any boss usage. Include the detected Three.js version string.
- Then output full unified diffs under `/diffs/` with a timestamped filename for:
  - `reactShell/package.json` edits
  - new `src/game/render/PostFX.ts`
  - new `reactShell/README.md`
  - new `/LICENSE`
  - any asset renames or moves needed to match vanilla
- New files must appear as `--- /dev/null` → `+++ <path>`. No snippets.

Execute now. Stop after printing the verification report and the diffs.
