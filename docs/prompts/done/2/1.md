PLANNING MODE — FULL BUILD PLAN FOR ASTEROIDS (vanilla → React/Three), as a **standalone folder ready to drop into the monorepo later**. 
Do NOT write code. Produce a complete, numbered plan that Sonnet will execute step-by-step.

Current status (facts)
- Repo/folder: /AsteroidsV2/reactShell (standalone package now; not in monorepo yet)
- Tooling: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript, Three.js 0.158.0
- Camera: orthographic; 1 world unit = 1 CSS pixel
- Render: default = direct renderer; EffectComposer (bloom/outline/vignette) available but off by default
- Start screen overlay implemented (assets/start_screen.png)
- Ship ported; mouse-aim, WASD/arrow thrust/turn, wrapping; sprite locked to 50px height
- Input live; assets under /public/assets/... (case-exact)
- Goal: exact parity with /AsteroidsV2/vanillaHTML/src/main.js as a drop-in package directory; **no monorepo work yet** (that comes after parity).

Deliverables (structure your output exactly like this)

1) One-page Roadmap
   - Phases that reach parity in the smallest safe increments Sonnet can ship (each step touches ~1–4 files, ends in a single diff+commit).

2) Feature Checklist with Acceptance Criteria
   - Bullets (cadence, TTL, speed, velocity inheritance, muzzle offset)
   - Collisions (bullet↔asteroid, ship↔asteroid, hunter↔ship; circle-circle)
   - Asteroids (L/M/S sizes, HP, spawn counts, split counts/velocities, ore types & yields)
   - Wave system (wave 1 start, progression/clear rules)
   - Enemy hunters (spawn wave ≥3, strafing, fire timing, boss1–boss10 sprites)
   - Particles & debris (density, lifetime)
   - HUD (score, wave, combo; currency if vanilla), Minimap
   - Upgrades (exact list/effects from vanilla; gating)
   - Pause/Restart, Status overlay/debug toggle, Audio (path parity)
   - Start/GameOver behavior, Hangar/shop if present in vanilla

3) Constants Map (compact table)
   - Constant | Value | Vanilla line(s) | Target file/const name
   - Include: movement, radii, bullet speed/TTL/cooldown, asteroid sizes/HP/splits, hunter timings, scoring, invuln windows, etc.

4) Module/File Breakdown (under src/)
   - game/entities/*  (Ship, Bullet, Asteroid, EnemyHunter, Particles, Debris)
   - game/systems/*   (Bullets, Collision, Spawning/Waves, Physics, Upgrades, Minimap)
   - game/render/*    (Scene, PostFX, Materials)
   - game/GameState.ts (shape & selectors), game/GameLoop.ts (update order)
   - ui/* (Hud, UpgradeMenu, PauseOverlay, GameOverScreen, Hangar)
   - For each file: public API (classes/functions, signatures) and what state it owns.

5) Numbered Execution Blocks (1..N)
   For EACH block provide:
   - Scope: exact file paths to create/update
   - API contracts to implement (signatures)
   - Done checks: concrete browser tests (e.g., “hold Space: bullets spawn at nose every X ms, TTL ≈ Y ms, wrap at edges”)
   - Risks & mitigations (1–3 bullets)
   - **The exact Sonnet EXECUTION MODE prompt** for that single step (include constraints, one unified diff under /diffs/, then commit/push)

   Suggested sequence (tune if needed):
   1) Bullets (spawn, TTL, velocity inheritance; no collisions)
   2) Collision system (bullet↔asteroid, ship↔asteroid; circle-circle)
   3) Asteroids (L/M/S with split logic + ore)
   4) Spawning/Waves controller
   5) HUD (score/wave/combo), basic Minimap
   6) Hunters (AI, fire timing, sprites)
   7) Particles & Debris
   8) Upgrades system + upgrade picker UI
   9) Pause/Restart + Status overlay
   10) Audio wiring (path parity) + SFX triggers
   11) Polish/Parity audit (numeric constants, speeds, timers, wrapping)

6) Verification Plan
   - Side-by-side comparisons with vanilla
   - Numeric audits (constants diffed against vanilla lines)
   - Asset path/casing validation
   - Dev vs prod build parity

7) **Drop-in Readiness for Monorepo (planning only, no code yet)**
   - Folder stays self-contained under `reactShell/` with:
     - package.json (name/scripts ready), vite.config base:'./', public/assets preserved
     - No cross-repo assumptions; env-free by default
   - What to expose when moved (e.g., `export default <App/>`, `npm run build` emits `/dist`)
   - Any flags to keep (DEV overlays behind backtick)

Constraints (apply to all Sonnet prompts you generate)
- Exact asset paths/casing (e.g., assets/Hanger.png, assets/boss/boss1.png…)
- Default render path = direct renderer; composer is optional flag
- No visual drift: port vanilla constants/behavior exactly
- Each Sonnet step outputs ONE timestamped unified diff under /diffs/ and then commits/pushes
- No scope creep beyond the block’s listed files
- TypeScript only; no new deps unless the block explicitly calls for them

Output format
- Roadmap
- Constants Table
- Module/File Breakdown
- Numbered Execution Blocks (each with its own Sonnet prompt)
- Verification Plan
- Drop-in Readiness notes

Do NOT write code. Produce the plan and per-step Sonnet prompts only.
