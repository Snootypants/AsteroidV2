APPROVE PLAN — Execute Visual Parity Corrections

Proceed with the plan exactly as written, with these specifics:
	1.	Camera/world units (GameCanvas.tsx)

	•	Orthographic camera with VISIBLE_HEIGHT = 99.6 world units (vertical).
	•	Width = VISIBLE_HEIGHT * aspect.
	•	Update resize to preserve VISIBLE_HEIGHT.
	•	Add util:
	•	pxToWorld(px): number = px * VISIBLE_HEIGHT / rendererHeightPx
	•	worldToPx(units): number = units * rendererHeightPx / VISIBLE_HEIGHT
	•	Update screen↔world conversions to use the new scale.

	2.	Shield visibility (GameState.ts & Ship.ts)

	•	Initialize shieldCharges = 0.
	•	Render shield ring only when invulnTimer > 0 || shieldCharges > 0.
	•	Invuln windows unchanged: start=3s, respawn=2s, hit=1s.

	3.	Entity visual sizing

	•	Ship: lock to ~50 px tall via pxToWorld(50); keep collision radius consistent with gameplay.
	•	Bullets: visual radius ~3–4 px (pxToWorld(3) default), add subtle emissive so they read on dark background.
	•	Asteroids: keep world radii 6 / 3.5 / 2; only adjust material for a touch more brightness (no physics changes).

	4.	Minimap

	•	Ensure minimap scaling is independent of the world camera change (no regressions).

	5.	Dev overlay (optional)

	•	Sliders: ship px height (40–60, default 50), bullet px radius (2–6, default 3), wired through the new pxToWorld.

Acceptance
	•	Ship ≈ 50 px; bullets clearly visible ≈ 3–4 px; asteroid sizes read correctly; shield ring not always on (only during invuln or with shield charges); wrapping ±375/±249 unchanged. No gameplay constants changed.

Output
	•	Single diff: diffs/visual_parity_fix_[timestamp].diff
	•	Build passes (npm run build), then commit and push.
