POLISH SPRINT 1 – Visual parity fixes (ship halo, bullets visibility, asteroid look)

Target repo: AsteroidsV2/reactShell. No gameplay changes, visuals only. One diff under /diffs/ and one commit+push.

Issues to fix
	1.	Ship has a gray/black block/halo
Likely due to PNG alpha handling or material settings.
	2.	Bullets are barely visible
Need brighter, larger, crisp dots (vanilla-like).
	3.	Asteroids look like dull gray turds
Need simple, clean 2D look with ore-color tint + subtle outline.

Required changes

A) Ship sprite/material (remove halo)
	•	In game/entities/Ship.ts (or wherever the mesh/material is created):
	•	Ensure we’re using a plane with PNG (ship.png) with proper alpha:
	•	material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map, transparent: true, depthWrite: false, alphaTest: 0.5, side: THREE.DoubleSide });
	•	After loading the texture:
	•	map.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;
	•	map.magFilter = THREE.NearestFilter;
	•	map.minFilter = THREE.NearestFilter;
	•	map.generateMipmaps = false;
	•	Do not use premultipliedAlpha=false on the renderer; instead rely on alphaTest to drop fringe.
	•	Verify the PNG truly has transparency (no black matte). If the asset is incorrect, fix by exporting with alpha or add a 1-px transparent bleed.

Acceptance: No visible rectangle/halo around ship at any scale; crisp edges.

B) Bullets visibility & style
	•	In game/entities/Bullet.ts & systems/BulletManager.ts:
	•	Visual should be small bright sprite/mesh:
	•	Keep radius logic for collisions, but render size ≈ 2–3px at 1:1 mapping.
	•	Use MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xffffff }) plus a soft additive glow option:
	•	Either a small white SpriteMaterial with transparent:true and a soft circle texture, or a tiny plane with a radial-gradient texture.
	•	Make sure they pop on dark background:
	•	If using color only: material.color.setHex(0xE6E6E6) and optionally material.emissive is not applicable on Basic; alternative: duplicate tiny bloom pass path when composer is enabled.
	•	Keep physics unchanged.

Acceptance: Holding fire shows clearly visible bright dots/mini-sparks from ship nose in facing direction at 70 u/s on dark backdrop.

C) Asteroid look (clean 2D style with ore tint)
	•	In game/entities/Asteroid.ts & game/render/Materials.ts:
	•	Replace flat gray with tinted disk + thin outline:
	•	Geometry: keep simple circle (or low-poly round) plane facing camera.
	•	Material: MeshBasicMaterial with color set by ore:
	•	iron: #9AA1A8, gold: #E3B341, platinum: #B9D3EE, adamantium: #7FFFD4 (adjust if needed).
	•	Outline: add a subtle darker rim:
	•	Option 1: second slightly larger disk behind with darker color & lower opacity (cheap faux outline).
	•	Option 2: custom fragment for radial darkening (simple smoothstep on uv radius).
	•	Randomize slight rotation over time for life, but keep strictly 2D billboard.

Acceptance: Large/med/small asteroids render as clean disks with a subtle outline and distinct ore tints; not muddy gray.

D) Optional tiny starfield tweak (if trivial)
	•	Ensure background stars are visible but faint (do not change density unless trivial):
	•	Stars as Points with size 1, low alpha (0.3–0.4), color #9aa or #889.
	•	No impact on perf.

Non-goals (do NOT change)
	•	No gameplay constants, speeds, hitboxes, spawn counts.
	•	Keep direct rendering default (composer toggle unchanged).
	•	Do not touch HUD/minimap layout in this sprint.

Deliverables
	•	Single diff: /diffs/polish_sprint1_[timestamp].diff
	•	Commit message: Polish: fix ship alpha fringe, brighten bullets, tint/outline asteroids
	•	Commit and push when done.
