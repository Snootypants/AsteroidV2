EXECUTION MODE — Fix runtime/build blockers and restore running game.

Context:
- Recent error: [plugin:vite:react-babel] Identifier 'shipPos' has already been declared in reactShell/src/game/GameCanvas.tsx around lines 240–250.
- After Block 11, the game isn’t running. We need a clean dev server with no red overlay and working gameplay.

Tasks:
1) GameCanvas.tsx audit & fix
   - Remove/rework duplicate const/let declarations in the same scope (e.g., `shipPos`).
   - Hoist a single `let shipPos: {x:number;y:number}` per frame OR reuse the existing variable; do not redeclare.
   - Scan the file for any other duplicate identifiers, shadowing, or duplicated imports introduced across Blocks 7–11 and fix.
   - Keep behavior identical (camera follow, orthographic mapping, RAF loop, update order).

2) Repo-wide quick sanity pass
   - Grep for “has already been declared” patterns in src/ and fix any similar duplicates created during merges (variable names and imports).
   - Ensure no duplicate default imports of THREE or PostFX helpers in a single module.
   - Ensure exported interfaces/types aren’t declared twice across files.

3) TypeScript/build check
   - Run `npm run build` to ensure zero TS errors.
   - Then run `npm run dev` and verify no Vite red overlay. If an error appears, capture the exact message and patch immediately.

4) Runtime verify
   - Confirm the game boots to Start screen, dismisses, and shows: ship, bullets, asteroids, collisions, waves, HUD, minimap, pickups working.
   - No console errors; HMR stable on file save.

Constraints:
- Do not change gameplay constants, visuals, or features beyond fixing dupes/imports and necessary build/runtime issues.
- No refactors outside what’s required to eliminate duplicates and errors.

Acceptance Criteria:
- `npm run build` passes without errors.
- `npm run dev` shows a running game (no red overlay), controls responsive, HUD/minimap visible.
- No duplicate identifier or duplicate import errors remain.
- Single unified diff documenting fixes.

Output:
- Write diff to `/diffs/fix_runtime_blockers_[timestamp].diff`
- Commit with message: "Fix duplicate declarations/imports; restore clean build & running dev server"
- Push.
