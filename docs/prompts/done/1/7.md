Planning mode task: audit and finalize PostFX parity with vanilla.

You are in planning mode. Do not generate diffs yet — produce a structured technical plan.

Scope:
- File: `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/render/PostFX.ts`
- Compare against `/AsteroidsV2/vanillaHTML/src/main.js`
- Three.js version: 0.158.0

Plan sections to output:

1. **Feature Parity Checklist**  
   - List exactly what PostFX must provide to match vanilla: composer pipeline, passes, bloom values, tone mapping, outputColorSpace, resize, render.

2. **Line-by-Line Audit**  
   - Identify what the current PostFX.ts already has.  
   - List missing items (e.g. composer.addPass(RenderPass), bloom params, resize, render).  
   - Flag any extra lines not present in vanilla (e.g. toneMappingExposure=1.2) that should be removed to avoid drift.  
   - Note import style (`.js` suffix vs none) needed under Vite.

3. **Integration Points**  
   - How PostFX connects to `GameCanvas` (renderer, scene, camera).  
   - How `resize` and `render` will be called from GameLoop.

4. **Risks & Mitigations**  
   - React StrictMode double-mount vs renderer creation.  
   - Asset path expectations.  
   - Version drift if imports are mismatched.  
   - Visual drift if exposure/toneMapping differ from vanilla.

5. **Execution Order**  
   - Step 1: Fix imports if needed.  
   - Step 2: Add RenderPass + BloomPass with correct params.  
   - Step 3: Add resize and render exports.  
   - Step 4: Remove or adjust exposure setting if vanilla doesn’t use it.  
   - Step 5: Verify build with Vite, then side-by-side test vs vanilla.

Deliverable: a clear plan with the items above, including the exact lines/functions that will need to be edited or added in PostFX.ts in the next execution phase.
