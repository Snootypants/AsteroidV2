Planning mode scope lock for PostFX parity.

Decisions:
- Match vanilla exactly. If vanilla bypasses the composer and calls `renderer.render(scene, camera)`, the React shell must do the same by default. Composer exists only as a disabled pipeline for future use or a debug toggle. No visual changes allowed.
- Only add VignetteShader if vanilla actually has that shader. Copy its GLSL verbatim. Do not approximate.

Tasks:
1) Evidence pull
   - From `/AsteroidsV2/vanillaHTML/src/main.js`, quote the exact lines showing:
     a) Direct call to `renderer.render(scene, camera)` during the frame loop
     b) Any composer setup and whether it’s commented or bypassed
     c) The vignette shader code and uniforms if present
     d) Bloom thresholds, strength, radius values
   - Output the line numbers so we can cross-check.

2) PostFX.ts plan
   - Default path: export a `render(delta)` that calls `renderer.render(scene, camera)` to match vanilla.
   - Keep a fully wired composer with `RenderPass`, `UnrealBloomPass`, `OutlinePass`, and `VignetteShader` only if confirmed in vanilla, but guard behind a `useComposer` boolean. When `useComposer` is false, composer is constructed but never used.
   - `resize(w,h)` must call both `renderer.setSize(w,h)` and `composer.setSize(w,h)` so flipping the toggle later is zero-diff.
   - Ensure `renderer.outputColorSpace` and `renderer.toneMapping` match vanilla. Remove `toneMappingExposure` if vanilla doesn’t set it.

3) Import specifiers
   - Use the exact `three@0.158.0` example import paths. Keep `.js` suffix consistent across all imports if required by Vite.

4) Risks
   - Any change in the default render path will alter visuals. Mitigation: keep default on direct render, provide internal toggle only for QA.
   - Shader drift if the vignette code is retyped. Mitigation: copy GLSL verbatim from vanilla.

Output:
- A short plan listing the exact lines to add or remove in `PostFX.ts` and `GameCanvas` to implement: default direct render, optional composer path, resize behavior, and any tone mapping adjustment.
- Do not generate diffs yet. Plan only, with quoted vanilla lines for evidence.
