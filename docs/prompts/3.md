Execute the verified corrections as a single scoped commit. Use exact versions and paths from the verification report. Do not alter gameplay code yet.

Tasks
1) package.json
   - In /AsteroidsV2/reactShell/package.json move "@types/three" from dependencies to devDependencies. Do not change versions.

2) PostFX stub
   - Create /AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/render/PostFX.ts
   - Import from three/examples/jsm at the exact Three.js version detected (0.158.0):
     - EffectComposer
     - RenderPass
     - UnrealBloomPass
     - OutlinePass
     - ShaderPass
   - Export a function `createComposer(renderer, scene, camera, size)` that:
     - Instantiates EffectComposer
     - Adds RenderPass
     - Adds UnrealBloomPass with the same numeric defaults used in vanilla if present, else set placeholders with TODO comments
     - Returns `{ composer, resize(w, h), render(delta) }`
   - Update no other files yet. This is a stub to lock example imports and prevent version drift.

3) LICENSE at repo root
   - Copy /AsteroidsV2/vanillaHTML/LICENSE to /AsteroidsV2/LICENSE byte for byte.

4) reactShell README
   - Create /AsteroidsV2/reactShell/README.md with:
     - Install: `npm install`
     - Dev: `npm run dev` and note port 3000 if enforced in vite.config.ts
     - Build: `npm run build`
     - Preview: `npm run preview`
     - Asset rules: assets live under `/public/assets/` with paths and casing mirrored from `/vanillaHTML`
     - Parity note: strict parity with `/vanillaHTML` for visuals, inputs, assets
     - Diff policy: every change must be committed as a full unified diff under `/diffs/`

Deliverables
- Print full unified diffs under `/diffs/` with a timestamped filename, ready for `git apply`, covering:
  - package.json edit
  - new src/game/render/PostFX.ts
  - new /LICENSE
  - new reactShell/README.md

Constraints
- Do not move or rename any assets in this pass
- Do not add gameplay code
- Use only the verified Three.js version and matching examples imports

Execute now and output only the diffs.
