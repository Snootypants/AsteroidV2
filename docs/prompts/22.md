EXECUTION MODE — lock Ship size to 50px and remove dev overlay. Output ONE unified diff under `/diffs/` only. Then commit and push.

Goal
- Make 50px the permanent ship height.
- Remove the DevTuningOverlay and all related wiring so the app runs clean.

Scope
- `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/entities/Ship.ts`
- `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/GameCanvas.tsx`
- `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/App.tsx`
- `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/ui/DevTuningOverlay.tsx` (delete)
- `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/styles.css` (remove overlay styles only if present)

Changes

1) Ship.ts
- Ensure a single constant is used for initial/default size:
  ```ts
  const SHIP_DESIRED_PX = 50;

	•	Keep setPixelHeight(px: number) implemented (useful later), but it won’t be driven by UI now.

	2.	GameCanvas.tsx

	•	Remove the shipPixelSize prop and any useEffect that watches it.
	•	On ship construction, call the ship’s internal default (50px). Do not wire runtime size changes.

	3.	App.tsx

	•	Remove Dev overlay state/handlers (showDev, backtick toggle, DEV button).
	•	Remove <DevTuningOverlay ... /> usage and import.

	4.	Delete the overlay component

	•	Delete file: src/ui/DevTuningOverlay.tsx.

	5.	styles.css

	•	Remove only the .dev-overlay / .dev-toggle rules if they were added; leave other styles intact.

Constraints
	•	Do NOT modify physics, input, PostFX, or start screen logic.
	•	Keep everything else as-is; this is strictly a cleanup + constant change.

Deliverable
	•	Print ONE timestamped unified diff under /diffs/ with all edits/deletions above (full patch, no truncation/summaries).
	•	After printing, commit and push.
