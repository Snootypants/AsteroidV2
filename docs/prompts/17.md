EXECUTION MODE — port Ship entity from vanilla into React shell. Output ONE unified diff under `/diffs/` only. Then commit and push.

Scope
- NEW: `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/entities/Ship.ts`
- NEW: `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/Input.ts` (if not already implemented)
- UPDATE: `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/GameCanvas.tsx`

Requirements

1) Input.ts
- Track keyboard states for thrust (W/ArrowUp), rotate left/right (A/D, ArrowLeft/Right), fire (Space or left click).
- Track mouse position in screen coords.
- Export an `InputState` interface and an `Input` class with `update()` and `getState()`.

2) Ship.ts
- Port constants + behavior from vanilla (`main.js`).
- Must support: thrust, rotation, world wrapping, spawn at origin, face mouse pointer at all times.
- Visual: replicate vanilla geometry/material. If vanilla uses `ship.png`, reference from `public/assets/ship/ship.png`.
- API:
  ```ts
  export class Ship {
    object: THREE.Object3D;
    constructor(scene: THREE.Scene);
    setAimWorld(target: THREE.Vector2): void;
    update(dt: number, input: InputState): void;
    getPosition(): THREE.Vector2;
  }

	3.	GameCanvas.tsx

	•	Instantiate Input and Ship.
	•	Add ship.object to scene.
	•	In RAF loop:
	•	Convert mouse screen coords to world coords, call ship.setAimWorld(...).
	•	Call ship.update(dt, input.getState()).
	•	Keep PostFX render path unchanged.
	•	Ship must be visible and respond to input once start screen is dismissed.

Constraints
	•	Do not implement bullets, asteroids, collisions, or HUD in this diff.
	•	Strict parity with vanilla Ship controls and feel.

Deliverable
	•	Print ONE timestamped unified diff under /diffs/ with the new Ship.ts, Input.ts, and GameCanvas.tsx edits. No truncation, no summaries.
	•	After diff, commit and push.
