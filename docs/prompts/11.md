EXECUTION MODE — Apply two tight fixes. Output a single unified diff under `/diffs/` only. No summaries, no truncation.

Scope
- `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/GameCanvas.tsx`
- `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/render/PostFX.ts`

Changes

1) Fix requestAnimationFrame delta handling in `GameCanvas.tsx`.
- Replace the current RAF loop that passes the raw timestamp into `render(...)`.
- Use a real delta in seconds. Exact pattern:

```ts
let last = performance.now();
function animate(now: number) {
  const dt = (now - last) / 1000;
  last = now;
  render(dt); // OK if dt is ignored in direct-render mode
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}
requestAnimationFrame(animate);

	2.	Ensure PostFX exports are complete in PostFX.ts.

	•	Confirm function render(delta: number) and function setUseComposer(flag: boolean) exist and are exported alongside resize and composer.
	•	If either is missing, add it. Default behavior must remain direct render:

let useComposerFlag = false;
export function setUseComposer(flag: boolean){ useComposerFlag = !!flag }
export function render(delta: number){
  return useComposerFlag ? composer.render(delta) : renderer.render(scene, camera);
}


	•	Do not change any other logic or parameters.

Notes
	•	Do not alter camera type yet. Add nothing except the items above.
	•	Keep import styles as they are (examples with .js suffix).

Deliverable
	•	Print ONE timestamped unified diff under /diffs/ containing only the edits above, ready for git apply. Print the FULL patch in a ```diff fenced block, with no elisions.
