Approved with edits.
	1.	Starfield.ts
Set mat.sizeAttenuation = true so PointsMaterial.size behaves as world units under the orthographic camera. Keep size = 1.2, z = -10, depthTest = false, depthWrite = false, transparent = true.
	2.	Import sweep
After deleting /reactShell/src/utils/units.ts, update any lingering imports in all touched files plus Asteroid.ts. No stale paths to ../../utils/units.
	3.	Unused imports
Remove pxToWorld imports anywhere it is not used to avoid TS unused warnings.
	4.	GameCanvas.tsx
Store the starfield instance and call starfield.update(dt) every frame after camera updates. No other loop changes.
