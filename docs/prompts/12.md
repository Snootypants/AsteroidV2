EXECUTION MODE — Apply two cleanup fixes. Output a single unified diff under `/diffs/` only. Then commit and push.

Scope
- `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/GameCanvas.tsx`

Changes

1) Add cleanup for the RAF loop.
- Before `requestAnimationFrame(animate)`, declare `let raf = 0;`.
- Assign the return value of `requestAnimationFrame` to `raf`.
- In the effect cleanup function, call `cancelAnimationFrame(raf)` so the loop stops on unmount.

2) Update resize handler to reset DPR.
- In the existing resize logic (window resize listener), before `renderer.setSize(width, height)`, add:
  ```ts
  renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio);

	•	This ensures correct scaling when devicePixelRatio changes.

Constraints
	•	Do not change any other logic.
	•	Keep imports and existing render/resize code untouched.

Deliverable
	•	Print ONE timestamped unified diff under /diffs/ containing only these edits.
	•	Print the FULL patch in a ```diff fenced block, no truncation, no summaries.
