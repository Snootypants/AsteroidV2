Proceed with Block 11: Currency Pickups & Magnetism.  

Use the execution prompt already defined in the plan for Block 11.  
Implementation details to cover:  
- NEW Pickup.ts entity with floating animation, TTL, and collection radius  
- Spawn currency drops when asteroids are destroyed, based on ore type drop rates (gold=27%, platinum=60%, adamantium=40%)  
- Magnetism: ship attracts pickups within radius (base + upgrade scaling)  
- Auto-collect after 10s if not picked up  
- Update GameState.currency on collection  
- Integrate pickup rendering into GameCanvas update loop  

Acceptance criteria:  
- ✅ Destroying a gold asteroid has ~27% chance to drop gold pickup  
- ✅ Platinum and adamantium pickups spawn at correct probabilities  
- ✅ Pickups float slightly, auto-collect after 10s  
- ✅ Ship auto-collects pickups within magnet radius  
- ✅ Currency totals update live in HUD panel
