Here’s the Block 5 execution prompt for Sonnet. Drop this in and let him run it.

EXECUTION MODE — Implement Enemy Hunters (AI + enemy bullets + wave≥3 spawns). Output ONE unified diff under `/diffs/` only. Then commit and push.

Scope
- NEW: /AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/entities/EnemyHunter.ts
- NEW: /AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/systems/EnemyBullets.ts
- UPDATE: /AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/systems/Spawning.ts
- UPDATE: /AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/systems/Collision.ts
- UPDATE: /AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/GameCanvas.tsx
- (Assets are already present) /public/assets/boss/boss1.png … boss10.png

Requirements

1) EnemyHunter entity (constants from plan)
- Radius: 1.2; accel: 20; maxSpeed: 26
- Fire rate: 0.9s; bulletSpeed: 55; bulletLife: 1.6s
- Preferred distance to player: 14 (strafing orbit)
- Speed scaling per boss level: ×1.2 each level
- Visual: use boss sprites from `assets/boss/boss1.png`…`boss10.png` (random, avoid immediate repeats)
- API:
  ```ts
  export class EnemyHunter {
    object: THREE.Object3D;
    radius: number; level: number;
    lastFireAt: number;
    constructor(level: number, pos: THREE.Vector2, spriteUrl: string);
    update(dt: number, shipPos: THREE.Vector2): void; // strafing AI: accelerate tangentially to maintain ~14u distance
    canFire(now: number): boolean;
  }

	2.	Enemy bullets system (separate from player bullets)

	•	File: systems/EnemyBullets.ts
	•	Manages pooled bullets fired by hunters.
	•	Bullet properties: speed=55, ttl=1.6s, small radius (match Collision expectations)
	•	Wrap at world bounds (±375, ±249).
	•	API:

export function createEnemyBullets(scene: THREE.Scene) {
  return {
    fire(from: THREE.Vector2, angleRad: number): void,
    update(dt: number): void,
    getAll(): { pos: THREE.Vector2; radius: number; object: THREE.Object3D }[]
  };
}



	3.	Spawning integration (wave ≥ 3)

	•	In Spawning.ts, add hunter spawns for wave ≥ 3:
	•	count = Math.min(1 + Math.floor((wave - 2)/2), 4)
	•	level = 1..n (affects speed scaling)
	•	spawn outside world by 20 units buffer like asteroids
	•	Ensure sprite selection pulls a random boss image each time; avoid repeating the same sprite twice in a row if multiple spawn.

	4.	Collision integration

	•	Ensure Collision.ts handles enemy bullets ↔ ship (damage ship unless invulnerable).
	•	Keep existing bullet↔asteroid, ship↔asteroid behavior unchanged.

	5.	Game loop wiring

	•	In GameCanvas.tsx, instantiate and update:
	•	Array/list of EnemyHunter instances per wave
	•	The enemy bullets system
	•	Per frame: update hunters (passing ship position), if canFire then enemyBullets.fire from hunter nose angle.
	•	Update enemyBullets after hunters.
	•	Optional: surface hunter and enemy bullet counts to DevPanel stats if it exists.

Constraints
	•	Do NOT touch PostFX, HUD, upgrades, or audio in this block.
	•	Asset paths/casing must match exactly: assets/boss/boss1.png … assets/boss/boss10.png.
	•	Keep default render path as direct renderer.

Acceptance tests (run in browser)
	•	On wave 1–2: no hunters spawn.
	•	On wave 3: at least 1 hunter spawns with a boss sprite, strafes around the ship at ~14u and fires every ~0.9s.
	•	Enemy bullets travel ~55u/s, expire ~1.6s, wrap at edges.
	•	Enemy bullets damage the ship (unless invulnerable).
	•	Higher waves spawn more hunters up to 4; movement speed scales ×1.2 per level.

Deliverable
	•	Print ONE timestamped unified diff under /diffs/ with all new/updated files. No truncation/summaries.
	•	After printing, commit and push with message: “Add Enemy Hunters (AI, enemy bullets, wave≥3 spawns)”.
