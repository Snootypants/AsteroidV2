Final pre-commit delta.

1) In reactShell/README.md, add a note: assets must be referenced exactly as in vanilla (`assets/...`, no leading slash). Update any sample code accordingly.

2) In vite.config.ts, set `export default defineConfig({ base: './', server: { port: 3000 } })`.

3) In src/main.tsx, remove React.StrictMode for now, or add a one-time mount guard in GameCanvas so the renderer is only created once during dev.

4) Add a short note to README about case sensitivity: run `git config core.ignorecase false` for this repo to avoid `Hanger.png` mismatches on macOS.
