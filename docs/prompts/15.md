EXECUTION MODE â€” clean repo and remove cube scaffold. Output a single unified diff under `/diffs/` only. Then commit and push.

Tasks

1) Remove node_modules from git and ignore it
- In `/AsteroidsV2/.gitignore`, add a line:

node_modules/

- Remove any accidentally committed node_modules files from the repo (`git rm -r --cached node_modules` equivalent).

2) Remove the temporary green cube scaffold
- In `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/GameCanvas.tsx`, delete the rotating cube geometry, material, mesh, and its animation logic.
- Keep the renderer, camera setup, RAF loop, and resize handling intact.
- Leave the scene empty for now; this is where entities will be added later.

Constraints
- Do not alter PostFX.ts or any other game logic.
- Only edit `.gitignore` and `GameCanvas.tsx` as described.
- Ensure the diff contains removal of the cube code but preserves all working infrastructure (renderer, scene, camera, loop, resize).

Deliverable
- Print ONE timestamped unified diff under `/diffs/` with the full content of these changes, no truncation or summaries.
- After generating the diff, commit and push.
