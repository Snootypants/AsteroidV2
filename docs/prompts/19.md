EXECUTION MODE — adjust ship visual size to 85% of current. Output ONE unified diff under `/diffs/` only. Then commit and push.

Scope
- `/AsteroidsV2/reactShell/src/game/entities/Ship.ts`

Changes
- Locate the constant:
  ```ts
  const SHIP_DESIRED_PX = 100;

	•	Change it to:

const SHIP_DESIRED_PX = 85;


	•	This reduces the ship’s rendered height to ~85% of current, keeping aspect ratio and pixel-perfect scaling intact.
	•	No other logic or files should change.

Deliverable
	•	Print ONE timestamped unified diff under /diffs/ with this single-line change. No truncation, no summaries.
	•	After diff, commit and push.
