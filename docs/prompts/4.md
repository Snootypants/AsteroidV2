Apply a final correction, then execute.

1) Remove the unused types package.
- In /AsteroidsV2/reactShell/package.json delete "@types/three". Three 0.158.0 includes its own types; the DefinitelyTyped package can conflict.

2) PostFX stub details.
- In PostFX.ts ensure:
  - renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio)
  - composer.setSize(size.width, size.height)
  - export { composer, resize(w,h), render(delta) } where render calls composer.render(delta)
  - Only import ShaderPass if a shader is actually used; otherwise omit it to keep the bundle clean.

3) Keep all verified asset paths and casing exactly as in vanilla, including Hanger.png and boss sprites under /public/assets/.

Deliverables:
- Output a single timestamped unified diff under /diffs/ that:
  - removes "@types/three" from package.json
  - adds or updates src/game/render/PostFX.ts with the details above
  - adds /AsteroidsV2/LICENSE at repo root if not already present
  - adds /AsteroidsV2/reactShell/README.md if not already present

No gameplay code yet. Execute now and print only the diffs.
